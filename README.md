# CAP 2 RSS
This is an old bit of a code that would pull any CAP feed at a URL (i.e. apps.fema.gov) and convert it to an RSS .xml file.

This is more or less just an untouched piece of code for someone to use in another project where it might be helpful. 
If you wish to make improvements on this code, feel free to do whatever with it, or make any pull requests as desired.

NOTE: This is currently not working as is and needs fixes. I will not be supporting this code, but you may request changes as desired.

## Setup
This script requires two dependencies.
```
py -m pip install PyRSS2Gen requests
```
