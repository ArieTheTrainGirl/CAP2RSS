# CAP 2 RSS
This is an old bit of a code that would pull any CAP feed at a URL and convert it to an RSS .xml file.
The URLs to the IPAWS bridge server are no longer valid, but this should support any CAP XML feed.


This is more or less just an untouched piece of code for someone to use in another project where it might be helpful. 
If you wish to make improvements on this code, feel free to do whatever with it, or make any pull requests as desired.
